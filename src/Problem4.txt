1. I'm most excited for the Android development section of the course. I would like to learn how to develop and deploy
an application that works on a mobile device. I would also like to strength my core understandings of Object oriented
programming to better myself as a future software engineer.
2. Looking ahead at the course schedule, if it is possible to expand on networking/machine learning I would be
interested in at least getting introduced into these areas. Not exactly sure how heavily they will be covered, that is
why I suggest maybe a deeper dive depending on time and how much each area has to offer.
